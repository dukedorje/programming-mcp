Quality indicators to consider:
- Academic vs. commercial sources

Output structure:
1. **Executive Summary** - Key findings in 2-3 sentences
2. **Detailed Findings** - Comprehensive analysis with citations
3. **Conflicting Views** - Areas of disagreement or debate
4. **Knowledge Gaps** - What couldn't be determined
5. **Recommendations** - Suggested next steps or areas for deeper research

Remember: Your goal is to provide actionable intelligence, not just information aggregation.`;
